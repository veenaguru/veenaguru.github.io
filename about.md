Eing has over ten years of both testing and development experience in software. She started as an aerospace developer creating a real-time database for an air traffic control system. She was also an enterprise software developer at Sun Microsystems before finding her passion in testing and test automation. Her strong technical background enabled her to create a fully automated test infrastructure for financial systems at PayPal. Currently at Intuit, she had led many projects including overseeing quality of over 500 mobile applications, performance testing, as well as definition and execution of quality strategy, standards on tools, frameworks and best practices.

Eing is still mastering the craft of testing and automation and also enjoys river kayaking, reading and gardening in her spare time.
